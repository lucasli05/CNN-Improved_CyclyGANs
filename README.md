1.Binary Classification Models:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Vision Transformer (ViT): A transformer-based image classification tasks.
2.Explainability:

Saliency Maps: Highlight pixels based on gradient magnitudes without distinguishing between positive and negative influences, leading to ambiguous interpretations of feature importance.
Grad-CAM: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping.

3.CycleGAN
proposed to gradually decay the weight of cycle consistency loss Î» as training progress
VGG19 performs forward propagation of the generated image and the target image to extract the feature maps of a particular layer (Feature Maps) for cycleloss.
